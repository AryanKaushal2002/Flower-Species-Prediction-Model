# Flower Species Prediction Model (Iris Flower)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implements a machine learning model for flower species prediction using the Iris flower dataset. The model is built using scikit-learn and Python.

## Dataset
- The model is trained on the [Iris flower dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).
- The dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

## Model
- The model is based on a supervised learning algorithm called the Random Forest Classifier.
- It uses decision trees and ensemble techniques to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.

## Usage
- Download the [Iris flower dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).
- Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file in this repository.
- Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- scikit-learn (version 0.24 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The results can be viewed and analyzed within the Jupyter Notebook.
